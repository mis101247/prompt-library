    "prompt": "Reference scale: the outer diameter of the flange is exactly 360 mm. Mechanical engineering drawing sheet with three separate drawings of the same part placed in clearly separated rectangular areas. Drawing 1: fully dimensioned orthographic views (front, top, side) with precise numeric measurements in millimeters, diameter symbols, radius annotations, hole count notation and center lines. Drawing 2: sectional view taken through the center axis of the part, showing internal geometry with proper section hatching and wall thickness clearly visible. Drawing 3: isometric reference view of the part without any dimensions, used only for spatial understanding. ISO mechanical drafting standard, consistent line weights, monochrome black lines on white background, manufacturing-ready technical documentation, no perspective distortion.",
