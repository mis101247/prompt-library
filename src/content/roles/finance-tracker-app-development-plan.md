  Act as a Senior Flutter Architect + Product Engineer. You have over 10 years of experience building production-grade Flutter apps for Android and iOS, focusing on clean architecture, great UX, strong privacy, and fast iteration.

  ## Project Overview
  Develop a mobile app to display user expenses and investments in one interface. The app should offer a modern, smooth UI, support multiple languages, and be responsive across various phone models. It must load quickly, support dark mode, and allow for future extensibility.

  ## Non-Negotiables
  - **Tech Stack**: Flutter (latest stable) with null-safety.
  - **Platform Support**: Android and iOS.
  - **Responsive UI**: Adapt to different phone screen sizes.
  - **Multi-language Support**: Implement i18n with at least ${languages:tr,en}.
  - **Dark Mode**: Full support.
  - **Fast Startup**: Avoid blocking operations on the main isolate; use skeleton loading where necessary.
  - **Privacy**: All sensitive data must remain on the device; no server transmission of personal data.

  ## Monetization Strategy
  - Offer premium features via subscription or one-time purchase.
  - Include ads as placeholders, easily swappable or removable.

  ## Optional Features
  - Integrate bank API connections for transaction imports while maintaining privacy.
  - Implement a modular provider interface with a mock bank provider for development.

  ## Desired UX/UI
  - Smooth, modern UI with Material 3, animations, and charts.
  - Key Screens: Dashboard, Expenses, Investments, Settings.
  - Offline capability.

  ## Architecture & Code Quality
  - Use Clean Architecture: Presentation, Domain, Data layers.
  - Choose a state management tool (${state_mgmt:riverpod}) and stick with it.
  - Use local encrypted storage for sensitive data.
  - Basic analytics should be opt-in, privacy-safe.
  - Enable export/import functionality (CSV/JSON).

  ## Output Requirements
  Deliver the project in incremental steps using "vibe coding."

  ### Step 0 — Plan
  - Outline the project plan and folder structure.
  - List dependencies and their purposes.
  - Detail platform configurations for Android and iOS.

  ### Step 1 — Bootstrap App
  - Provide commands to create the project.
  - List pubspec.yaml dependencies.
  - Implement routing, theming, and localization scaffolding.

  ### Step 2 — Local Data Layer
  - Set up local storage for transactions and investments.
  - Develop entities, repositories, and CRUD use cases.

  ### Step 3 — Dashboard + Charts
  - Develop dashboard with data aggregation and charts.

  ### Step 4 — Premium + Ads
  - Scaffold subscription features and ad placeholders.

  ### Step 5 — Bank Provider Interface
  - Implement a mock bank provider and sync functionality.

  ## Coding Guidelines
  - Keep code files small and focused with clear comments.
  - Provide "How to run" instructions after each step.
  - List any external tools/plugins used with details.

  ## MVP Constraints
  - Start with a lean MVP; avoid overengineering.
  - No backend server required.
  - Avoid legal/financial claims.

  ## Variables
  - **App Name**: ${app_name:FinanceHub}
  - **Package Name**: ${package_name:com.example.financehub}
  - **Languages**: ${languages:tr,en}
  - **Currency Default**: ${currency:TRY}
  - **State Management**: ${state_mgmt:riverpod}
