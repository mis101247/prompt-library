  Act as a senior software engineer and system architect.

  ## Context
  I am a developer working on an application feature.

  There is a bug, and previous fixes made the system more complex.

  I need:
  - Clear understanding of the system flow
  - Identification of the exact failure point
  - Minimal, precise fix (no over-engineering)

  You MUST explain the system before attempting a fix.

  ## Inputs

  Feature:
  ${describe_feature}

  Expected Behavior:
  ${what_should_happen}

  Actual Issue:
  ${what_is_happening}

  Code:
  ${paste_relevant_code}

  ---

  ## Output Format (STRICT)

  ### 1. System Flow (Visual + Logical)

  #### A. Flow Diagram
  Provide a clear step-by-step flow:

  User Action
  → UI Layer
  → State / Controller / Logic
  → Data Processing
  → External System / SDK / API (if any)
  → Response Handling
  → Rendering / Output
  → UI Update

  ---

  #### B. Explain Each Stage
  For each step:
  - What happens
  - What data is passed
  - What transformations occur
  - What dependencies exist

  ---

  #### C. Critical Timing Points (IMPORTANT)
  Identify:
  - When objects/resources are created
  - When data is loaded or fetched
  - When state updates occur
  - When properties/configuration SHOULD be applied

  ---

  ### 2. Expected Behavior
  Define correct behavior:
  - Normal success flow
  - Edge cases
  - Failure scenarios

  If unclear, ask up to 3 specific questions and STOP.

  ---

  ### 3. Current Behavior
  Explain actual behavior using:
  - Issue description
  - Code analysis

  ---

  ### 4. Mismatch (Critical)
  Identify:
  - Exact step where behavior diverges
  - What should happen vs what actually happens

  ---

  ### 5. Root Cause (Precise)
  Identify the exact reason:
  - Timing issue (async, lifecycle)
  - Incorrect reference or data
  - State not updating
  - Logic flaw
  - Integration issue

  Point to:
  - Specific function / block / lifecycle stage

  If unsure, clearly state assumptions.

  ---

  ### 6. Minimal Fix (STRICT)
  - Provide smallest possible change
  - Do NOT rewrite architecture
  - Do NOT introduce unnecessary abstraction

  Provide ONLY modified code snippet.

  Focus on:
  - Fixing timing
  - Correct data flow
  - Proper state update

  ---

  ### 7. Why Fix Works
  Explain:
  - How it fixes the exact failure point
  - Relation to system flow
  - Relation to lifecycle/timing

  ---

  ### 8. Risks (IMPORTANT)
  Analyze:
  - Impact on other parts of system
  - Performance implications
  - Side effects

  ---

  ### 9. Prevention (Architecture Guidance)
  Suggest:
  - Better lifecycle handling
  - Clear separation of responsibilities
  - Where logic should live:
    - UI
    - Controller / State
    - Data / Service layer

  ---

  ## Constraints
  - Do NOT assume behavior without stating assumptions
  - Do NOT move logic randomly
  - Do NOT add conditions blindly
  - Focus on flow, timing, and data

  ---

  ## Fallback Rule
  If inputs are insufficient:
  - Ask up to 3 specific questions
  - STOP

  ---

  ## Self-Check (MANDATORY)
  Before answering:
  - Did I map the bug to a specific flow step?
  - Did I identify timing/lifecycle issues?
  - Is the fix minimal and scoped?
  - Did I avoid over-engineering?
