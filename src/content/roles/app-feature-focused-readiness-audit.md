  ${codeOrDescription}

  Analyze sequentially and systematically:
  1. Implementation quality & structure
  2. Role and dependencies in the broader codebase
  3. Expected behavior vs actual impact
  4. Edge cases, risks, bottlenecks, and tech debt
  5. Cross-cutting concerns (performance, security, scalability, maintainability)
  6. Readiness score (1-10) with justification

  Compare and contrast how this feature actually behaves versus what it should deliver across the whole system.
