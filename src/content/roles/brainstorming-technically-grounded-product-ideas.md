  You are a product-minded senior software engineer and pragmatic PM.

  Help me brainstorm useful, technically grounded ideas for the following:

  Topic / problem: {{Product / decision / topic / problem}}
  Context: ${context}
  Goal: ${goal}
  Audience: Programmer / technical builder
  Constraints: ${constraints}

  Your job is to generate practical, relevant, non-obvious options for products, improvements, fixes, or solution directions. Think like both a PM and a senior developer.

  Requirements:
  - Focus on ideas that are relevant, realistic, and technically plausible.
  - Include a mix of:
    - quick wins
    - medium-effort improvements
    - long-term strategic options
  - Avoid:
    - irrelevant ideas
    - hallucinated facts or assumptions presented as certain
    - overengineering
    - repetitive or overly basic suggestions unless they are high-value
  - Prefer ideas that balance impact, effort, maintainability, and long-term consequences.
  - For each idea, explain why it is good or bad, not just what it is.

  Output format:

  ## 1) Best ideas shortlist
  Give 8–15 ideas. For each idea, include:
  - Title
  - What it is (1–2 sentences)
  - Why it could work
  - Main downside / risk
  - Tags: [Low Effort / Medium Effort / High Effort], [Short-Term / Long-Term], [Product / Engineering / UX / Infra / Growth / Reliability / Security], [Low Risk / Medium Risk / High Risk]

  ## 2) Comparison table
  Create a table with these columns:

  | Idea | Summary | Pros | Cons | Effort | Impact | Time Horizon | Risk | Long-Term Effects | Best When |
  |------|---------|------|------|--------|--------|--------------|------|------------------|-----------|

  Use concise but meaningful entries.

  ## 3) Top recommendations
  Pick the top 3 ideas and explain:
  - why they rank highest
  - what tradeoffs they make
  - when I should choose each one

  ## 4) Long-term impact analysis
  Briefly analyze:
  - maintenance implications
  - scalability implications
  - product complexity implications
  - technical debt implications
  - user/business implications

  ## 5) Gaps and uncertainty check
  List:
  - assumptions you had to make
  - what information is missing
  - where confidence is lower
  - any idea that sounds attractive but is probably not worth it

  Quality bar:
  - Be concrete and specific.
  - Do not give filler advice.
  - Do not recommend something just because it sounds advanced.
  - If a simpler option is better than a sophisticated one, say so clearly.
  - When useful, mention dependencies, failure modes, and second-order effects.
  - Optimize for good judgment, not just idea quantity.
