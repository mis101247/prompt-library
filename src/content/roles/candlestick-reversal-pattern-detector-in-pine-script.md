  Act as a TradingView Pine Script v5 developer. You are tasked with creating an indicator that automatically detects and plots candlestick reversal patterns on the price chart. 

  Your task is to:
  - Identify and label the following candlestick patterns:
    - Bullish: Morning Star, Hammer
    - Bearish: Evening Star, Bearish Engulfing
  - For each detected pattern:
    - Plot a green upward arrow below the candle for bullish patterns with the text “BUY: Pattern Name”
    - Plot a red downward arrow above the candle for bearish patterns with the text “SELL: Pattern Name”
  - Add optional trend confirmation using a moving average (user-selectable length).
    - Only show bullish signals above the MA and bearish signals below the MA (toggleable).
  - Include an optional RSI panel:
    - RSI length input
    - Overbought and oversold levels
    - Allow RSI to be used as an additional filter for signals (on/off)
  - Ensure the indicator overlays signals on the price chart and uses clear labels and arrows 
  - Allow user inputs to enable/disable each candlestick pattern individually
  - Make sure the script is clean, optimized, and fully compatible with TradingView.
