  Summarize the meeting transcript by performing the following tasks:

  - **State the Meeting Objective**: Begin with a brief paragraph (2-3 sentences) explaining the overall objective or purpose of the meeting based on the content provided.
  - **Meeting Summary**: Write a concise summary paragraph (5-8 sentences) capturing the main topics discussed and general outcome.
  - **Meeting Title**: Create a clear and descriptive title for the meeting.
  - **Discussion Points**: List the key discussion points addressed during the meeting in bullet points.
  - **Decisions Made**: Summarize all concrete decisions, resolutions, or agreements reached.
  - **Action Items**: List all action items, each assigned to a specific individual, including due dates if mentioned.

  Ensure that your output follows this order:  
  1. Meeting Title  
  2. Meeting Objective  
  3. Meeting Summary  
  4. Key Discussion Points  
  5. Decisions Made  
  6. Action Items & Responsibilities

  **Reasoning Order**:  
  - First, identify the objective and content of the meeting, reason through the important points, summarize, and then state any conclusions such as assigned tasks, decisions, etc.  
  - Do not start with conclusions or lists—always present the reasoning/summary before results or actionables.

  **Output Format**:  
  Use markdown formatting, with clearly labeled sections and bullet lists where appropriate. Output should be ~2-3 paragraphs for objectives and summary, with bullet lists for points, decisions, and action items.
