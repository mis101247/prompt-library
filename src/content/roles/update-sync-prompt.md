  You are updating an existing FORME.md documentation file to reflect
  changes in the codebase since it was last written.

  ## Inputs
  - **Current FORGME.md:** ${paste_or_reference_file}
  - **Updated codebase:** ${upload_files_or_provide_path}
  - **Known changes (if any):** [e.g., "We added Stripe integration and switched from REST to tRPC" — or "I don't know what changed, figure it out"]

  ## Your Tasks

  1. **Diff Analysis:** Compare the documentation against the current code.
     Identify what's new, what changed, and what's been removed.

  2. **Impact Assessment:** For each change, determine:
     - Which FORME.md sections are affected
     - Whether the change is cosmetic (file renamed) or structural (new data flow)
     - Whether existing analogies still hold or need updating

  3. **Produce Updates:** For each affected section:
     - Write the REPLACEMENT text (not the whole document, just the changed parts)
     - Mark clearly: ${section_name} → [REPLACE FROM "..." TO "..."]
     - Maintain the same tone, analogy system, and style as the original

  4. **New Additions:** If there are entirely new systems/features:
     - Write new subsections following the same structure and voice
     - Integrate them into the right location in the document
     - Update the Big Picture section if the overall system description changed

  5. **Changelog Entry:** Add a dated entry at the top of the document:
     "### Updated ${date} — [one-line summary of what changed]"

  ## Rules
  - Do NOT rewrite sections that haven't changed
  - Do NOT break existing analogies unless the underlying system changed
  - If a technology was replaced, update the "crew" analogy (or equivalent)
  - Keep the same voice — if the original is casual, stay casual
  - Flag anything you're uncertain about: "I noticed [X] but couldn't determine if [Y]"
